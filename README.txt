   - Optional: Generate a shortcode via *WooCommerce > Settings > Tax Switch > Shortcode*

=== Usage ===

After installation and configuration, you can add the tax switch to your pages in two ways:

1. Use the Gutenberg block "Tax Switch for WooCommerce" in your page or post editor.
2. Use the shortcode `[wdevs_tax_switch]` anywhere in your content.

= Shortcode Usage =

**Switch/buttons**

Basic usage:
[wdevs_tax_switch]

Displays a switch to toggle displaying prices including or excluding VAT.

The shortcode accepts several attributes to customize its appearance and behavior:

* `class-name`: Adds custom CSS classes to the switch.
    - Default: is-style-default
    - Options: is-style-default, is-style-inline, or custom classes
* `switch-type`: Determines the style of the toggle.
 	- Default: `switch`
 	- Options: `switch`, `buttons`
* `switch-color`: Sets the color of the switch handle.
* `switch-color-checked`: Sets the color of the switch when it's in the "on" position.
* `switch-background-color`: Sets the background color of the switch.
* `switch-text-color`: Sets the text color of the switch labels.
* `switch-background-color-checked`: Sets the background color of the switch when it's in the "on" position.
* `switch-label-incl`: Sets the text for the "including VAT" label.
    - Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Incl. VAT" if not set.
* `switch-label-excl`: Sets the text for the "excluding VAT" label.
    - Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Excl. VAT" if not set.

Example with custom attributes:

`[wdevs_tax_switch class-name="is-style-inline" switch-type="switch" switch-color="#ffffff" switch-color-checked="#000000" switch-background-color="#000000" switch-background-color-checked="#4CAF50" switch-text-color="#FF0000" switch-label-incl="Incl. tax" switch-label-excl="Excl. tax"]`


**Label**

Basic usage:
[wdevs_tax_switch_label]

Displays text indicating the currently selected tax setting. The text updates automatically when the tax switch is toggled.

The shortcode accepts several attributes to customize its appearance and behavior:

* `class-name`: Adds custom CSS classes to the label.
    - Default: is-style-default
    - Options: is-style-default or custom classes
* `label-text-incl`: Sets the text to display when "including VAT" is selected.
    - Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Incl. VAT" if not set.
* `label-text-excl`: Sets the text to display when "excluding VAT" is selected.
    - Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Excl. VAT" if not set.
* `label-text-color`: Sets the "excluding VAT" text color.
* `label-text-color-checked`: Sets the "including VAT" text color.

Example with custom attributes:

`[wdevs_tax_switch_label class-name="tax-indicator" label-text-incl="Prices include tax" label-text-excl="Prices exclude tax" label-text-color="#FF0000" label-text-color-checked="#4CAF50"]`


= PHP implementation =

You can use these shortcodes with PHP with the do_shortcode() function:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[wdevs_tax_switch]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[wdevs_tax_switch_label]'); ?>`


= JavaScript events =

The switch fires a JavaScript event when the tax display is toggled. You can listen for this event to execute custom code when a user switches between inclusive and exclusive VAT display. This is useful for when you need to perform additional actions based on the tax display state.

`
document.addEventListener('wdevs-tax-switch-changed', function(event) {
   console.log(event.detail);
   // event.detail contains:
   // - isSwitched: boolean - the raw switch state
   // - displayIncludingVat: boolean - whether prices now display including VAT
 });
`

If you are loading the switch dynamically (via AJAX), dispatch this event after rendering to initialize the component:

`
   document.dispatchEvent( new CustomEvent('wdevs-tax-switch-appeared') );
`

=== WPML ===

To translate the option texts via WPML:

1. Save your options first in: WooCommerce -> Settings -> Tax Switch
2. Then translate the texts in: WPML -> String Translations and search for your option values in the domain 'tax-switch-for-woocommerce'

=== Compatibility ===

This plugin integrates with WooCommerce's standard filters and actions for price display and calculation. While most plugins and themes work out of the box, some third-party code use custom price building methods that require specific compatibility integrations.

* Thrive
* Flatsome
* Kapee
* Entr
* Woodmart

The following plugins have been tested and confirmed compatible:

* WooCommerce Product Table Lite (+ PRO)

If you encounter any compatibility issues with other plugins or themes, please let us know. Your feedback helps us improve the plugin and extend compatibility to more third-party solutions.

=== Incompatibility ===

After multiple attempts to create compatibility functions, reaching out to the plugin developers several times, and still finding no viable solution, the following plugins remain incompatible:

* Unlimited Elements for Elementor (+ Pro): AJAX pagination and filtering issues
* Barn2: WooCommerce Product Options


== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly or Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/tax-switch-for-woocommerce` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure your settings as described in the 'Configuration' section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any known compatibility issues? =

Some WooCommerce Blocks are not fully compatible with this plugin as they do not use standard WooCommerce filters for price display. This is a known limitation of WooCommerce Blocks and not specific to this plugin. You can fix this by using WooCommerce shortcodes instead of the WooCommerce Blocks.

= Why do prices stay the same after switching? =

Sometimes prices may not appear to change when toggled. This is often related to WooCommerce tax settings. If possible, select 'Shop based' in WooCommerce → Settings → Tax → "Calculate tax based on". Otherwise, WooCommerce requires a billing/shipping address to calculate taxes, which is typically only available after login or during checkout.

= Why don't prices update in the cart/checkout when switching? =

The plugin is designed to keep prices consistent in the cart and checkout process. There are two main reasons for this:

1. **Customer clarity**: This ensures visitors always see the exact final amount they'll pay, without unexpected changes during checkout.
2. **Technical simplicity**: While dynamic price switching could be implemented, it would require compatibility with various third-party cart/checkout plugins. The focus is, at the moment, on maintaining a lightweight and reliable solution rather than this specific feature.
