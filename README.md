## Getting started

These instructions will guide you through the installation and basic setup of the Tax Switch for WooCommerce plugin.

### Configuration

Configure the plugin settings below for proper functionality.

#### WooCommerce settings

Ensure these WooCommerce settings are configured first:

1. **Configure tax calculations**
	- Go to: *WooCommerce > Settings > General*
	- Verify your shop address is complete
	- Enable *"Enable tax rates and calculations"*
	- Set *"Default customer location"* to *"Shop base address"*

2. **Set up tax rates**
	- Go to: *WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Standard Rates*
	- Add your regional tax rates

3. **Recommended: tax calculation method**
	- Go to: *WooCommerce > Settings > Tax*
	- Set *"Calculate tax based on"* to *"Shop base address"*
	  *(This provides instant tax calculation. Other methods require customers to enter their address first.)*

4. **Individual product configuration**
	- Edit products at: *Products > [Product]*
	- Under *Product Data > Tax*, set status to *"Taxable"*

#### Plugin settings

Configure these plugin-specific settings:

1. **Main settings**
	- Go to: *WooCommerce > Settings > Tax Switch*
	- Set your preferred text values
	- Optional: Generate a shortcode via *WooCommerce > Settings > Tax Switch > Shortcode*


### Usage

After configuration, you can add the tax switch to your pages in two ways:

1. Use the Gutenberg block "Tax Switch for WooCommerce" in your page or post editor.
2. Use the shortcode `[wdevs_tax_switch]` anywhere in your content.

The switch will toggle the display of prices including or excluding VAT across your site.

### Shortcode Usage

#### Switch/buttons

The plugin provides a shortcode that allows you to easily add the tax switch anywhere on your site.

Basic usage:

[wdevs_tax_switch]

This will display the default tax switch.

The shortcode also accepts several attributes to customize its appearance:

- `class-name`: Adds custom CSS classes to the switch.
    - Default: `is-style-default`
    - Options: `is-style-default`, `is-style-inline`, custom classes
- `switch-type`: Determines the style of the toggle.
	- Default: `switch`
	- Options: `switch`, `buttons`
- `switch-color`: Sets the color of the switch handle.
- `switch-color-checked`: Sets the color of the switch when it's in the "on" position.
- `switch-background-color`: Sets the background color of the switch.
- `switch-background-color-checked`: Sets the background color of the switch when it's in the "on" position.
- `switch-text-color`: Sets the text color of the switch labels.
- `switch-label-incl`: Sets the text for the "including VAT" label.
    - Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Incl. VAT" if not set.
- `switch-label-excl`: Sets the text for the "excluding VAT" label.
    - Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Excl. VAT" if not set.

Example with custom attributes:

`[wdevs_tax_switch class-name="is-style-inline" switch-type="switch" switch-color="#ffffff" switch-color-checked="#000000" switch-background-color="#000000" switch-background-color-checked="#4CAF50" switch-text-color="#FF0000" switch-label-incl="Incl. tax" switch-label-excl="Excl. tax"]`

This will display an inline-style switch with a white handle that turns black when on, a black background when off, green background when on, and custom labels for including and excluding tax.

#### Label

Basic usage:
[wdevs_tax_switch_label]

Displays text indicating the currently selected tax setting. The text updates automatically when the tax switch is toggled.

Attributes:
- `class-name`: Adds custom CSS classes to the label.
	- Default: `is-style-default`
	- Options: `is-style-default` or custom classes
- `label-text-incl`: Sets the text to display when "including VAT" is selected.
	- Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Incl. VAT" if not set.
- `label-text-excl`: Sets the text to display when "excluding VAT" is selected.
	- Default: Uses the text set in the plugin settings or "Excl. VAT" if not set.
- `label-text-color`: Sets the "excluding VAT" text color.
- `label-text-color-checked`: Sets the "including VAT" text color.

Example with custom attributes:
`[wdevs_tax_switch_label class-name="tax-indicator" label-text-incl="Prices include tax" label-text-excl="Prices exclude tax" label-text-color="#FF0000" label-text-color-checked="#4CAF50"]`


#### PHP implementation

You can use these shortcodes with PHP with the do_shortcode() function:

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode('[wdevs_tax_switch]'); ?>
<?php echo do_shortcode('[wdevs_tax_switch_label]'); ?>
```

#### JavaScript events

The switch fires a JavaScript event when the tax display is toggled. You can listen for this event to execute custom code when a user switches between inclusive and exclusive tax display. This is useful for when you need to perform additional actions based on the tax display state.

```
document.addEventListener('wdevs-tax-switch-changed', function(event) {
    console.log(event.detail);
	// event.detail contains:
	// - isSwitched: boolean - the raw switch state
	// - displayIncludingVat: boolean - whether prices now display including VAT
});
```

### WPML

To translate the option texts via WPML:

1. Save your options first in: WooCommerce -> Settings -> Tax Switch
2. Then translate the texts in: WPML -> String Translations and search for your option values in the domain 'tax-switch-for-woocommerce'

## Known Issues

### Compatibility with WooCommerce Blocks

Some WooCommerce Blocks are not fully compatible with this plugin as they do not use standard WooCommerce filters for price display. This is a known limitation of WooCommerce Blocks and not specific to this plugin. You can fix this by using WooCommerce shortcodes instead of the WooCommerce Blocks.

For more information and updates on this issue, please refer to the following GitHub issue:
[WooCommerce Blocks Issue #8972](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/8972)

We are monitoring this issue and will update the plugin accordingly when a solution becomes available. In the meantime, the tax switch functionality may not work as expected with certain WooCommerce Blocks.

### Incompatibility

After multiple attempts to create compatibility functions, reaching out to the plugin developers several times, and still finding no viable solution, the following plugins remain incompatible:

- Unlimited Elements for Elementor (+ Pro): AJAX pagination and filtering issues
